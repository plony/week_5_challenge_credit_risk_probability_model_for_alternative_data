Task 1
Basel II Accord's Influence on Model Interpretability: The Basel II Accord mandates robust risk measurement and capital adequacy, requiring credit risk models to be interpretable and well-documented. This is crucial for regulatory compliance, effective model validation, transparent risk management, and mitigating model risk by ensuring auditors and stakeholders understand the model's logic and assumptions behind credit decisions and capital calculations.

Necessity of Proxy Variable and Associated Risks: A proxy variable for "default" is essential because direct default labels are unavailable, enabling the training of a predictive model from behavioral data like RFM patterns. However, relying on a proxy carries significant business risks, primarily the potential for misclassification (false positives or negatives) if the proxy doesn't accurately reflect true creditworthiness, leading to missed revenue, financial losses, and reputational damage. It also introduces risks related to data bias and the proxy's relevance over time.

Trade-offs: Simple vs. Complex Models: In a regulated financial context, there's a key trade-off between model interpretability and predictive performance. Simple models (e.g., Logistic Regression with WoE) offer high interpretability, regulatory acceptance, and ease of explanation, but may yield lower accuracy. Complex models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) offer superior predictive performance by capturing complex data relationships, but their "black box" nature makes them difficult to interpret, explain, and validate for regulators, posing challenges for transparency, bias identification, and compliance. The choice balances maximizing accuracy with meeting regulatory demands for transparency and explainability.

Ultimately, the choice depends on the specific use case, the level of regulatory scrutiny, the available data, and the bank's risk appetite and technological capabilities. For Bati Bank's "buy-now-pay-later" service, starting with a more interpretable model might be prudent to establish a clear and defensible credit scoring process, with potential for exploring more complex models as the system matures and regulatory frameworks become clearer regarding alternative data models.
